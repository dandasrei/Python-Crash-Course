As you're learning to program, it's helpful to think about the real-world projects you'd like
to create. It's a good habit to keep an 'ideas' notebook that you can refer to whenever you
want to start a new project. If you haven't done so already, take a few minutes and describe
three projects you'd like to create. As you're learning you can write mall sprograms that 
relate to these ideas, so you can get practice writing code relevant to topics you're 
interested in.
